# BrowserDB

### Mission

A document based database is needed on the browser. IndexedDB fills in this gap but has a terribly confusing API.

Can we provide a simpler API for IndexedDB? Can we make this API similar to popular document based data stores?

Enter BrowserDB.

### In-browser only

BrowserDB should be used in the browser only. It is not a server side JavaScript library. It depends on the browser.
